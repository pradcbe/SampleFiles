1) Create a new S3 Bucket (S3BucketName: clientmay2020) to upload the python Source code (ReadFile.py.zip)
Note: This S3 bucket is only for uploading the code. if this bucket name is not available, we need to modify the cloud
formation template to use a new name(line :71)
Once the deployment python File has been uploaded to S3, We are ready to deploy the code using cloud formation template

2) Download the cloud formation template file (CFT.JSON) to you local system (say C:\test)
and Go to AWS Console and select Cloud Formation --> Create Stack

3) In Create Stack Screen --> specify Template --> Upload Template File

4)Click Choose File and navigate to the Cloud formation JSON file downloaded to you local system (c:\test\CFT.JSON)
and click "Next"

5) Enter Stack Name (say : AIGSampleCode) and click "Next"

6) Click Next on the "Configure Stack Options" Screen for these test exercise

7) In the next screen "Review AIGSampleCode" , select "Acknowlege checkbox" under Capabilities and click "Create Stack"
Note: This can be automated

8) Appropriate Events are triggered and the follow components are created automatically and there should not be any issue
Roles and Role policies will be created, a new s3bucket name: aigsamples3bucket  will be created, new lambda function
will be created and roles are associated with S3 and lambda function.
Note: if the roles and s3buckets are existing already before executing this cloudformation template, then the system
 will thrown an error and Cloud formation template will fail

9) Go to "Lambda". You should be able to see a lambda function name : CFTAIGLambda

10)Click this "CFTAIGLambda" function and the code will be displayed

11)It can be tested in AWS UI console by configuring test events.

12)Click 'Select a test event' drop down and select "Configure Test Events"

13)Add "AIGTest" as event name and paste the below event to pass S3 bucket name as a parameter
{
  "BucketName":"aigsamples3bucket"
}

Scoll to the bottom and click "Create"

14) Pls make sure you see the "AIGTest" in the dropdown and You can click the "Test"

15)The response will be displayed (ex: {"files": []}) since no files are uploaded

16) Please upload the file to s3 bucket and run the "AIGTest" event "Test" again. You will able to see the json
will uploaded file name in JSON Format.

{ “files”: [{ “name”: “file1”}, {“name”: “file2”},…]}
